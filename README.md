# A Crowded Room: What if you shared a room with all the journalists imprisoned in 2022? :newspaper::lock:
Project 3, Lede Program 2023

This repository has a dataset and HTML code for my third project in the Lede Program for Data Journalism at Columbia University.

## About the project
I attempted to develop a new and impactful visualization using the <b>Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) data</b>. The goal was to allow the reader to feel (and not only to understand logically) how severe is the violation of press freedom in some countries around the world. <b>The project follows a concept:</b> The main visualization emulates a crowded room, and the charts and map have a blueprint style.

# Data
All the data used in the project comes from the monitoring carried out by CPJ. You can access the database [here](https://cpj.org/data/imprisoned/2022/?status=Imprisoned&start_year=2022&end_year=2022&group_by=location).

# Challenges and new skills
As it is a visualization project, my main challenges were related to using D3.js to create and activate tooltips on the map. It took me a while to understand how to do it, and I still don't know how to prevent some countries from overlapping with themâ€”this is a work in progress.

During the project, I improved my abilities to use Adobe Illustrator to create interesting data visualizations, learned more about AI2HTML, CSS, and D3.js.
